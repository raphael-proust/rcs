%Projects

This is a list of projects I am considering putting some effort into. (When I
have more free time.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Sam filter/pipe

Loving both `acme(1)` and `vim(1)` I find myself missing one's feature when
using the other, especially `sam(1)`'s command language when using `vim(1)`.

Hopefully, `vim(1)` supports filters and allows one to `:{range}!{filter}` to
pipe the text in `range` through `filter`. Thus creating a `sap(1)` (`sap`
stands for `sam pipe`) command is all that is needed to make `sam(1)` commands
available in `vim(1)`.

The command would

- read from `stdin`,
- write to `stdout` and,
- execute the `sam(1)` command given as argument.

Additional options would include:

- `-c <file>` execute command from `file`,
- `-i <file>` modify `file` inplace (i.e. use it as input and output),
- `-o <file>` output to `file` instead of `stdout`,
- `<file>` read file instead of `stdin`,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Suckless git front-end

Although `git(1)`'s back-end is very good, the front-end is

- difficult to use,
- an amalgame of scripts, perl code, and other things,
- very chatty, and
- awh-no-what-happened-to-my-repository-again?

Thus the project.

##A new back-end for Mirage: self-hosted web-apps

[Self-hosted
web-apps](http://drwho.virtadpt.net/archive/2013/03/14/a-new-way-to-write-web-applications)
would fit nicely as a Mirage back-end. Moreover, it is a nice use for a
Javascript back-end in Mirage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Signpost

How nice would it be if one could just refer to all its electronics via
`<hostname>.<tld>` (e.g. `billie.raphael.signpost.io` (`billie` is my laptop's
name), `avalanche.raphael.signpost.io` (my Raspberry Pi), &c.).

The signpost projects aims at making this addressing Just Workâ„¢ using tricks
such as effectful DNS requests, NAT punching, VPN, &c.
