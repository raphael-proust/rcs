##Status

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/)
of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) under supervision of
[Alan Mycroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/). I am working on linear
types and their use for system programming.

I submitted my [first year report](./1styrrep.pdf).

I am a student of [Magdalene college](http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/) and am
involved in the MCR committee.

##Past

I have been an intern at the [Gallium team](http://gallium.inria.fr/) at
[INRIA](http://www.inria.fr), working on intermediate representations for
compilers (especially functional ones such as CPS and ANF) under supervision
by [Xavier Leroy](http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/).

I have been a student at the [ÉNS
Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) (more specifically at its
Brittany extension) in Computer Science.

I have been an intern at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/)
of the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). The internship
featured different aspects of the [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) project
(notably the use of linear types for efficiency and functional reactive
programming for dynamic reconfiguration) and was supervised by [Anil
Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/) and hosted by [Jon
Crowcroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/)

I have been a student at [Paris 7 Denis Diderot]() University in both Computer
Science and Mathematics.
